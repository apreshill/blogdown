Welcome to the blogdown GitHub repo ðŸ‘‹

We use the GitHub repository mainly to respond to bug reports and feature requests. The issue tracker is not for asking questions. However, in some cases, linking to unanswered questions can help us trace bugs or improve our documentation. 

You may use an issue to link to an existing but unanswered question about blogdown here. The best places to ask questions are:

- Stack Overflow with the `blogdown` tag: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/blogdown>

- RStudio Community with the `blogdown` tag: <https://community.rstudio.com/tag/blogdown>

<!-- 
Please complete and keep the checklist below in your issue. Your issue will be closed if any boxes are not checked.
