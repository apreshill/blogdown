Welcome to the blogdown GitHub repo ðŸ‘‹

The primary documentation for learning and using the blogdown R package is available online for free at this website: <https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/>

If you have read the [book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), use this issue to suggest ways for us to improve the documentation. Please feel free to suggest new topics to add, or to let us know that an existing topic was unclear and needs to be revised. 

Note that some of the existing documentation is out-of-date due to changes in Hugo and the blogdown package. We are actively working on updating the book, but in the meantime appreciate your input!
